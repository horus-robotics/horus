# User Acceptance Test: Environment Management (`horus env`)

## Feature
Freeze and restore project environments for reproducible builds and shareable development setups.

## User Story
As a robotics developer, I want to freeze my project's dependency environment and restore it on other machines so that my team can work with identical package versions and ensure reproducible builds.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Freeze Current Environment
**Given:** User has a project with installed packages
**When:** User runs `horus env freeze`
**Then:**
- [ ] All installed packages are recorded with exact versions
- [ ] File `horus-freeze.yaml` is created in current directory
- [ ] File includes system information (OS, architecture)
- [ ] File includes HORUS version used
- [ ] Success message lists all frozen packages
- [ ] File is human-readable YAML format

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
$ horus env freeze
 Freezing environment...
 Recorded 5 packages:
  â€¢ horus-core v0.1.0
  â€¢ lidar-driver v1.2.0
  â€¢ sensor-common v1.0.2
  â€¢ slam-toolkit v0.8.1
  â€¢ nav-stack v2.1.0
 Environment frozen to horus-freeze.yaml
```

**Example `horus-freeze.yaml`:**
```yaml
# HORUS Environment Freeze File
# Generated: 2024-10-24 12:00:00 UTC

**When:** User runs `horus env freeze`
**Then:**
- [ ] Local packages recorded with relative paths
- [ ] Git packages recorded with commit hashes
- [ ] Restore reproduces exact state including local deps

**Note:** Mark as FUTURE FEATURE if not yet implemented

### Scenario 15: Environment Diff (FUTURE)
**Given:** User has made changes to environment
**When:** User runs `horus env diff`
**Then:**
- [ ] Shows differences between current and frozen environment
- [ ] Additions shown (packages installed after freeze)
- [ ] Removals shown (packages removed after freeze)
- [ ] Version changes highlighted
- [ ] Suggestion to refreeze if desired

**Acceptance Criteria (FUTURE):**
```bash
$ horus env diff
Environment differences from horus-freeze.yaml:

  + new-package v1.0.0 (added)
  - old-package v0.5.0 (removed)
  ~ lidar-driver v1.2.0  v1.3.0 (upgraded)

Run 'horus env freeze' to update the freeze file
```

**Note:** Mark as FUTURE FEATURE for v0.2.0+

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Freeze File Corruption
**Given:** `horus-freeze.yaml` is corrupted or invalid
**When:** User runs `horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml`
**Then:**
- [ ] YAML parsing error detected
- [ ] Error: "Freeze file is corrupted or invalid"
- [ ] Specific parse error shown (line number, if possible)
- [ ] Suggestion to regenerate with `freeze`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
$ horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml
Error: Failed to parse freeze file

YAML error at line 12: unexpected character
Consider regenerating the freeze file:
  horus env freeze
```

### Edge Case 2: Network Failure During Publish
**Given:** User runs `horus env freeze --publish`
**And:** Network fails during upload
**When:** Publish attempt is made
**Then:**
- [ ] Local freeze file is still created successfully
- [ ] Error message about network failure
- [ ] User can retry publish separately (if command exists)

### Edge Case 3: Large Number of Packages
**Given:** Project has 50+ packages installed
**When:** User runs `horus env freeze` and `restore`
**Then:**
- [ ] Freeze completes in reasonable time (< 5 seconds)
- [ ] Restore shows progress indicator
- [ ] All packages handled correctly
- [ ] No performance degradation

### Edge Case 4: Cross-Platform Freeze/Restore
**Given:** Freeze created on Linux, restore on macOS
**When:** User restores environment on different OS
**Then:**
- [ ] Warning about OS difference (if packages are OS-specific)
- [ ] Restoration attempts compatible packages
- [ ] OR clear error if packages are platform-incompatible

### Edge Case 5: Freeze with Development Dependencies
**Given:** Project has both normal and dev dependencies
**When:** User runs `horus env freeze`
**Then:**
- [ ] Both types of dependencies are frozen
- [ ] Dependencies are marked in freeze file
- [ ] Restore reinstalls all (or option to skip dev deps)

## Integration Tests

### Integration 1: Team Collaboration Workflow
**Scenario:**
1. Developer A freezes environment: `horus env freeze --publish`
2. Environment ID shared with team
3. Developer B restores: `horus env restore env_<ID>`
4. Both developers have identical package versions

**Then:**
- [ ] Environment is identical across machines
- [ ] Projects build and run consistently
- [ ] No version mismatch errors

### Integration 2: CI/CD Pipeline
**Scenario:**
1. Repository includes `horus-freeze.yaml`
2. CI script runs `horus env restore` before build
3. Build uses exact package versions
4. Deployment is reproducible

**Then:**
- [ ] CI can restore environment reliably
- [ ] Builds are reproducible
- [ ] No unexpected package updates

### Integration 3: Environment Versioning
**Scenario:**
1. Freeze environment for v1.0: `horus env freeze -o v1.0-freeze.yaml`
2. Update packages
3. Freeze environment for v2.0: `horus env freeze -o v2.0-freeze.yaml`
4. Can restore either version as needed

**Then:**
- [ ] Multiple freeze files can coexist
- [ ] Easy to switch between environment versions
- [ ] Project versions are reproducible

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Freeze completes in < 2 seconds for typical projects
- [ ] Restore shows progress for packages taking > 3 seconds
- [ ] Freeze file is human-readable and editable (YAML)
- [ ] Atomic restore (all packages or none)
- [ ] Freeze file includes metadata (date, HORUS version, OS)
- [ ] Published environments are immutable (cannot be modified)
- [ ] Environment IDs are globally unique

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] README explains freeze/restore workflow
- [ ] Examples for team collaboration
- [ ] CI/CD integration guide
- [ ] Freeze file format documented
- [ ] Best practices for environment management
- [ ] Troubleshooting common issues

## Security Considerations

- [ ] Freeze files do not contain sensitive data (tokens, passwords)
- [ ] Published environments are public by default (warn user)
- [ ] Restore validates package checksums
- [ ] Freeze includes package hashes for verification

**Then:**
```bash
$ horus env --help
Manage project environment
