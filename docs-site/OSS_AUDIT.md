## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Performance Numbers Updated

**Before:**
- Advertised: "85ns IPC latency"
- Mentioned: "29ns Link, 97ns Hub"
- Focus: Raw, minimal benchmarks

**After:**
- Production: "366ns-2.8μs for real robotics messages"
- Realistic: "100-270x faster than ROS2"
- Context: Production benchmarks with serde serialization

**Files Updated:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Hero section stats and features
- `content/docs/getting-started.mdx` - Why HORUS section
- `content/docs/core.mdx` - Performance comparison table

### 2. Marketplace References Removed

**Removed:**
- `https://marketplace.horus.dev` links in nav/footer
- "GitHub OAuth authentication" feature description
- Package registry commercial references

**Replaced With:**
- "Open Source" - MIT/Apache-2.0 licensed

### 4. Documentation Content Updated

**Technical Accuracy:**
- Removed outdated "29ns/97ns" claims
- Added production message types (CmdVel, LaserScan, IMU, Odometry)
- Updated architecture diagrams
- Fixed performance comparison tables

**OSS Messaging:**
- Emphasized MIT/Apache-2.0 license
- Highlighted community contributions
- Removed capital/monetization language
- Added "Join the open-source community" CTAs

## 🔒 Privacy & Security
