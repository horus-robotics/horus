# Installing HORUS

Get HORUS up and running in 5 minutes. We'll install Rust, build HORUS, and verify everything works.

## What You'll Need

**Required:**
- **Linux or macOS** - HORUS uses shared memory (available on both)
- **10-15 minutes** - For first-time installation
- **Internet connection** - To download dependencies

**Don't worry if you don't have:**
- Rust (we'll install it)
- Git (we'll install it)
- Experience with systems programming (not needed!)

## Quick Install (Recommended)

Copy and paste these commands into your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Install Rust (takes ~2 minutes)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# 2. Clone HORUS
git clone https://github.com/your-org/HORUS
cd HORUS

# 3. Install the horus CLI (takes ~5 minutes)
cargo install --path horus_manager

# 4. Verify it works
horus --version
```

If you see `horus 0.3.0` (or similar), you're all set! Skip to [Next Steps](#next-steps).

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Install Rust

HORUS is built with Rust. Don't worry if you've never used it - you don't need to know Rust to use HORUS (Python and C work too!).

**On Linux or macOS:**
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Follow the prompts (just press Enter for defaults).

**Restart your terminal or run:**
```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

**Verify Rust is installed:**
```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

You should see version numbers like `rustc 1.75.0`.

**On Windows:**
Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):
```powershell
# In PowerShell (as Administrator)
wsl --install

# Then follow Linux instructions inside WSL
```

### Step 2: Install Git (If You Don't Have It)

**Check if you have Git:**
```bash
git --version
```

**If not, install it:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git

# macOS
xcode-select --install

# Fedora
sudo dnf install git
```

### Step 3: Clone HORUS

Download the HORUS source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/HORUS
cd HORUS
```

This creates a `HORUS` directory with all the code.

### Step 4: Build and Install

Build everything and install the `horus` command globally:

```bash
# This takes ~5 minutes the first time
cargo install --path horus_manager
```

You'll see a lot of output - that's normal! Rust is compiling everything.

### Step 5: Verify Installation

Test that the `horus` command works:

```bash
horus --version
```

You should see:
```
horus 0.3.0
```

Try the help command:
```bash
horus --help
```

You should see a list of available commands like `new`, `run`, `dashboard`, etc.

## Optional: Python Support

Want to use HORUS with Python? Here's how:

```bash
# 1. Install maturin (Python build tool)
pip install maturin

# 2. Navigate to Python bindings
cd horus_py

# 3. Build and install (takes ~3 minutes)
maturin develop --release

# 4. Test it works
python -c "import horus; print('✅ Python bindings work!')"
```

See [Multi-Language](/docs/multi-language) for Python examples.

## Optional: C Support

Want to integrate C code? Build the C bindings:

```bash
cd horus_c
cargo build --release
```

The shared library will be in `target/release/`:
- `libhorus_c.so` (Linux)
- `libhorus_c.dylib` (macOS)

See [Multi-Language](/docs/multi-language) for C examples.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

Most things "just work" on Linux. If you hit build errors:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config
```

### Linux (Fedora/RHEL)

```bash
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

### macOS

Install Xcode Command Line Tools if you haven't:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Note:** macOS has smaller shared memory limits than Linux. For most applications this is fine, but if you're moving lots of large messages, Linux is better.

### Windows

Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run: `wsl --install`
3. Restart your computer
4. Follow the Linux installation steps inside WSL

## Understanding Shared Memory

HORUS uses `/dev/shm` for ultra-fast communication between components.

**Check available space:**
```bash
df -h /dev/shm
```

You should have at least 256MB. Most systems have 1-2GB.

**If you need more space (advanced):**
```bash
# Temporarily increase to 2GB
sudo mount -o remount,size=2G /dev/shm

# Make permanent: edit /etc/fstab (requires sudo)
# Add line: tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,size=2G 0 0
```

## Updating HORUS

To update to the latest version:

```bash
# Pull latest changes
cd HORUS
git pull

# Rebuild and reinstall
cargo install --path horus_manager --force
```

The `--force` flag replaces the old version.

## Uninstalling

To completely remove HORUS:

```bash
# Remove the horus command
cargo uninstall horus_manager

# Remove source code
rm -rf ~/HORUS  # or wherever you cloned it

# Clean up shared memory files (optional)
rm -f /dev/shm/horus/*
```

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: horus"

The cargo bin directory isn't in your PATH. Fix it:

```bash
# Add to your shell config (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

# Then reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### "linker `cc` not found"

You need a C compiler:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install build-essential

# macOS
xcode-select --install

# Fedora
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

### Build takes forever

First build is slow (5-10 minutes). Subsequent builds are much faster (seconds).

If it's taking more than 15 minutes, you might have a slow internet connection or limited CPU. Try building with fewer CPU cores:

```bash
cargo install --path horus_manager -j 2
```

### "permission denied: /dev/shm"

Check permissions:

```bash
ls -la /dev/shm

# Should be writable by your user
# If not:
sudo chmod 1777 /dev/shm
```

### Python bindings fail

Make sure you have Python development headers:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install python3-dev

# macOS (usually included)

# Then retry:
pip install maturin
cd horus_py
maturin develop --release
```
