# Multi-Language Support

HORUS supports multiple programming languages, allowing you to choose the best tool for each component of your robotics system.

## Supported Languages

### Rust (Native)

**Best for:** High-performance nodes, control loops, real-time systems

HORUS is written in Rust and provides the most complete API. All examples in the documentation use Rust by default.

**Getting Started:**
```bash
horus new my-project
# Select: Rust (option 2)
```

**Learn more:** [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start)

### Python

> **üöß Under Development**: Python bindings are currently under active development.

**Best for:** Rapid prototyping, AI/ML integration, data processing, visualization

Python bindings provide a simple, Pythonic API for HORUS. Perfect for integrating with NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other Python libraries.

**Getting Started:**
```bash
horus new my-project
# Select: Python (option 1)
```

**Learn more:** [Python Bindings](/python-bindings)

### C (Alpha)

**Best for:** Hardware drivers, legacy system integration, embedded systems

C bindings provide low-level access to HORUS from C code. Currently in alpha with basic pub/sub support.

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha - Basic functionality only

**Learn more:** [C Bindings](/c-bindings)

## Cross-Language Communication

**All languages can communicate seamlessly** through HORUS's shared memory system:

```python
# Python publisher
import horus
node = horus.Node(name="sensor", pubs="temperature")
node.send("temperature", 25.5)
```

```rust
// Rust subscriber (in another process)
let hub = Hub::<f32>::new("temperature")?;
if let Some(temp) = hub.recv(None) {
    println!("Temperature: {}", temp);
}
```

## Choosing a Language

| Use Case | Recommended Language |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Control loops** | Rust (lowest latency) |
| **AI/ML models** | Python (ecosystem) |
| **Hardware drivers** | C or Rust |
| **Data processing** | Python or Rust |
| **Real-time systems** | Rust |
| **Prototyping** | Python (fastest development) |

## Mixed-Language Systems

You can build systems with nodes in different languages:

**Example: Robot with mixed languages**
- **Motor controller** (Rust) - 1kHz control loop
- **Vision processing** (Python) - PyTorch object detection
- **Hardware driver** (C) - Legacy sensor integration
- **Dashboard** (Rust) - Real-time visualization

All communicate through HORUS shared memory with **sub-microsecond latency**.
