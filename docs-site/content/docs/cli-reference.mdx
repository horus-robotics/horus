## `horus new` - Create Projects

**What it does**: Creates a new HORUS project with all the boilerplate set up for you.

**Why it's useful**: No need to remember dependencies or configuration - just pick a language and start coding.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode (asks you questions)
horus new my_project

# Rust with helpful macros (recommended!)
horus new my_project --macro

# Python project
horus new my_project --python

# C project
horus new my_project --c
```

### All Options

```bash
horus new <NAME> [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -m, --macro              Rust with node! macro (less boilerplate)
  -r, --rust               Plain Rust project
  -p, --python             Python project
  -c, --c                  C project
  -o, --output <PATH>      Where to create it (default: current directory)
```

### Examples

**Start with Rust + macros** (easiest):
```bash
horus new temperature_monitor --macro
cd temperature_monitor
horus run
```

**Python for prototyping**:
```bash
horus new sensor_test --python
cd sensor_test
python main.py
```

**Put it somewhere specific**:
```bash
horus new robot_controller --output ~/projects/robots
```

---

## `horus run` - Build and Run

**What it does**: Compiles your code and runs it. Handles all the build tools for you.

**Why it's useful**: One command works for Rust, Python, and C. No need to remember `cargo run`, `python3`, or `gcc` commands.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run current directory (finds main.rs, main.py, or main.c)
horus run

# Run specific file
horus run src/controller.rs

# Run optimized (100x faster!)
horus run --release
```

### All Options

```bash
horus run [FILE] [OPTIONS] [-- ARGS]

Options:
  -r, --release            Optimize for speed (use for real testing!)
  -b, --build-only         Just compile, don't run
  -c, --clean              Remove old build files first
  -R, --remote <ROBOT>     Run on a remote robot
  -- <ARGS>                Arguments for your program
```

### Why --release Matters

**Debug mode** (default): Fast to compile, slow to run
- Good for: Trying things quickly
- Speed: Messages take ~5-50μs

**Release mode** (`--release`): Slow to compile, fast to run
- Good for: Real testing, benchmarks, production
- Speed: Messages take ~366ns-1.58μs (100x faster!)

**Always use `--release` when measuring performance!**

### Examples

**Daily development**:
```bash
horus run
# Fast iteration, slower execution
```

**Testing performance**:
```bash
horus run --release
# See real speed
```

**Build for CI without running**:
```bash
horus run --build-only --release
```

**Fresh build** (when things act weird):
```bash
horus run --clean --release
```

**Run on your robot**:
```bash
horus run --remote 192.168.1.100
# Builds here, runs there
```

**Pass arguments to your program**:
```bash
horus run -- --config robot.yaml --verbose
```

---

## `horus dashboard` - Monitor Everything

**What it does**: Opens a visual dashboard showing all your running nodes, messages, and performance.

**Why it's useful**: Debug problems visually. See message flow in real-time. Monitor performance.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Web dashboard (opens in browser)
horus dashboard

# Different port
horus dashboard 8080

# Text-based (for SSH)
horus dashboard --tui
```

### What You See

The dashboard shows:
- **All running nodes** - Names, status, tick rates
- **Message flow** - What's talking to what
- **Performance** - CPU, memory, latency per node
- **Topics** - All active communication channels
- **Graph view** - Visual network of your system

### Examples

**Start monitoring** (in a second terminal):
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run your app
horus run --release

# Terminal 2: Watch it
horus dashboard
```

**Access from your phone**:
```bash
horus dashboard
# Visit http://your-computer-ip:3000 from phone
```

**Monitor over SSH**:
```bash
ssh robot@192.168.1.100
horus dashboard --tui
```

See [Dashboard Guide](/dashboard) for detailed features.

## `horus pkg` - Package Management

**What it does**: Install and manage reusable components.

**Why it's useful**: Don't reinvent the wheel. Use components others have built and tested.

### Commands

```bash
# Install a package
horus pkg install <package>

# Remove a package
horus pkg remove <package>

# List packages
horus pkg list

# Unpublish a package from registry
horus pkg unpublish <package>
```

### Examples

**Install a package**:
```bash
horus pkg install pid-controller
```

**Install specific version**:
```bash
horus pkg install pid-controller -v 1.2.0
```

**Install globally** (share across projects):
```bash
horus pkg install common-utils --global
```

**See what's installed**:
```bash
horus pkg list
```

**Search for packages**:
```bash
horus pkg list sensor
```

**Remove a package**:
```bash
horus pkg remove pid-controller
```

**Unpublish from registry** (irreversible!):
```bash
horus pkg unpublish my-package -v 1.0.0
```

---

## `horus env` - Environment Management

**What it does**: Save and restore your exact setup (all package versions).

**Why it's useful**: Share your setup with teammates. Deploy the same version to production. Time-travel to old configurations.

### Commands

```bash
# Save current environment
horus env freeze

# Load saved environment
horus env restore <file>
```

### Examples

**Save your setup**:
```bash
horus env freeze
# Creates horus-freeze.yaml
```

**Load teammate's setup**:
```bash
horus env restore teammate-setup.yaml
```

**Deploy exact production environment**:
```bash
# On production machine
horus env restore production.yaml
```

---

## `horus publish` - Share Your Package

**What it does**: Upload your package so others can use it.

**Why it's useful**: Share your work with the community or your team.

### Usage

```bash
horus publish
```

### Requirements

- Must be in a project directory
- Must be logged in (`horus auth login`)

### Example

```bash
# Create and publish
horus new my_awesome_controller --macro
cd my_awesome_controller
# ... build and test it ...
horus auth login --github
horus publish
```

---

## `horus auth` - Login to Registry

**What it does**: Authenticate so you can publish packages.

**Why it's useful**: Secure access to the package registry.

### Commands

```bash
# Login with GitHub
horus auth login --github

# Generate API key (for CI/CD)
horus auth generate-key

# Check who you are
horus auth whoami

# Logout
horus auth logout
```

### Examples

**First time setup**:
```bash
horus auth login --github
# Opens browser for GitHub login
```

**Check you're logged in**:
```bash
horus auth whoami
```

**Generate API key for CI/CD**:
```bash
horus auth generate-key --name github-actions --environment ci-cd
# Save the generated key in your CI secrets
```

**Logout**:
```bash
horus auth logout
```

## `horus version` - Show Version Information

**What it does**: Display version information about your HORUS installation.

**Why it's useful**: Check what version you're running, verify installation, and get system information.

### Usage

```bash
horus version
```

### Example Output

```
HORUS - Hybrid Optimized Robotics Unified System
Version: 0.1.0
Build: release
Commit: abc123def456
Platform: linux-x86_64
Rust: 1.70.0
```

**Common uses**:
- Verify HORUS is installed correctly
- Check which version you're running
- Report version when filing bugs
- Confirm you have the latest version

---

## Common Workflows

### First Time Using HORUS

```bash
# Create a project
horus new my_first_app --macro
cd my_first_app

# Run it
horus run --release

# Monitor it (new terminal)
horus dashboard
```

### Daily Development

```bash
# Make changes to code
vim src/main.rs

# Test quickly
horus run

# Test for real
horus run --release
```

### Deploy to Production

```bash
# Clean build
horus run --clean --release

# Save the environment
horus env freeze --output production.yaml

# Deploy to robot
horus run --remote production-robot --release
```

### Share Your Work

```bash
# Login once
horus auth login --github

# Publish
horus publish

# Others can now:
horus pkg install your-package-name
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: horus"

Add cargo to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### "Port already in use"

```bash
# Use different port
horus dashboard 3001

# Or kill the old process
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

### Build is slow

First build is always slow (5-10 min). After that it's fast (seconds).

Use `--release` only when you need speed, not during development.

### "Failed to create Hub"

Topic name conflict. Try a unique name or clean up:

```bash
rm -rf /dev/shm/horus/*
```

---

## Environment Variables

Optional configuration:

```bash
# Custom registry (for companies)
export HORUS_REGISTRY_URL=https://your-company-registry.com

# Debug mode (see what's happening)
export RUST_LOG=debug
horus run

# CI/CD authentication
export HORUS_API_KEY=your-key-here
```
