# HORUS Roadmap to Beta

**Status**: Core framework is production-ready. Beta focuses on developer experience: language bindings, documentation, and testing.

## 1. Core Framework (COMPLETE)

### Performance & Reliability
- -**Link (SPSC)**: 248ns median latency (production-validated)
- -**Hub (MPMC)**: 437ns median latency (production-validated)
- -**Session isolation**: Via `HORUS_SESSION_ID` environment variable
  - Sessions use isolated directory: `/dev/shm/horus/sessions/{session_id}/`
  - Cleanup: `rm -rf /dev/shm/horus/sessions/{session_id}` (entire session at once)
  - No individual file cleanup needed (Drop intentionally disabled)
- -**Crash detection**: `NodeState::Crashed` tracking
- -**Graceful degradation**: Buffer overflow handling
- -**Topic statistics**: Comprehensive atomic metrics (Hub & Link)
- -**Node health monitoring**: Heartbeat with state tracking
- -**Priority-based scheduling**: NodePriority 0-4
- -**Execution time tracking**: Min/max/avg per node
- -**6.2M+ messages tested**: Zero corruptions

**No remaining core tasks** - Framework is production-ready!

## 2. Language Bindings (15% of beta effort)

### 2.1 Python Bindings (100% Complete)

**Status:**

- -**Type hints**: 100% coverage with inline annotations for IDE autocomplete
- -**Documentation**: Complete docstrings and comprehensive API guides at `/docs/python-bindings.mdx`
- -**Basic testing**: 4 Python tests (timestamps, rate control, multiprocess) in `horus_py/tests/`
- -**Cross-language integration tests**: Comprehensive message integrity and cross-language tests in `horus_py/tests/`
- -**Pytest coverage reporting**: Full pytest coverage configuration with HTML, XML, and terminal reports

**Completed Items:**

## 4. Testing (~65% Complete )

**Status:**

-**Unit Tests (Unknown Coverage):**
- -23 Rust files contain `#[cfg(test)]` test blocks
- -41+ integration test files in `/tests/` directory
- ⏳ Actual coverage percentage unknown (target: 80%+)
- ⏳ No coverage reporting tool integrated

 **Integration Tests (70% Complete):**
- -Multi-node scenarios exist (41+ test files)
- -Multi-process tests exist (`horus_run` tests)
- -Python cross-language integration tests (Rust ↔ Python) complete
-  C cross-language integration tests (Rust ↔ C) missing - CRITICAL
-  Long-running stress tests (24+ hours) not in CI

 **Platform Tests (50% Complete):**
- -x86_64 Linux (Intel, AMD) tested in CI
-  ARM Linux (Raspberry Pi 4/5, Jetson) not tested - MEDIUM priority
- Note: Could add ARM build verification without full hardware testing

 **Performance Regression (Partial):**
- -Benchmark workflow exists
-  Not running on every commit
-  No automated alerting on >10% regression

**Remaining Work (Priority Order):**

1. [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add C cross-language integration tests (Rust ↔ C)
   - C++ publisher  Rust subscriber
   - Rust publisher  C++ subscriber
   - C++ driver  Rust/Python consumer
   - Test all standard message types

2. [ ] **HIGH**: Integrate Rust code coverage reporting
   - Add tarpaulin or cargo-llvm-cov to CI
   - Measure and report actual coverage percentage for Rust core
   - Target: 80%+ for core framework
   - Note: Python coverage already configured via pytest-cov

3. [ ] **HIGH**: Enable performance regression detection
   - Run benchmarks on every commit
   - Alert on >10% latency regression
   - Track trends over time

4. [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add ARM platform build verification
   - Cross-compile for ARM in CI
   - Even without hardware, verify builds work

5. [ ] **LOW**: Add long-running stress test (24+ hours)
   - Can be run manually, doesn't need CI
   - Verify message integrity over extended periods

## Beta Roadmap Summary

**Overall Progress**: ~75% Complete

**Component Status:**
- -Core Framework: 100% Complete (production-ready)
- -Python Bindings: 100% Complete (type hints, docs, cross-lang tests, pytest coverage)
-  C Bindings: 30% Complete (basic API, full coverage & docs pending)
- -Documentation: 75% Complete (tutorials, examples, ROS2 migration guide pending)
-  Testing: 70% Complete (CI, unit tests, Python cross-lang, Rust coverage pending)

**Remaining Critical Tasks**: ~10 high-priority items

**Priority Breakdown:**

**CRITICAL (Must-have for Beta):**
1. Code coverage measurement and reporting for Rust core (target: 80%+)
2. "Migrate from ROS2" documentation guide
3. Cross-language integration tests for C bindings (Rust ↔ C)

**HIGH (Should-have for Beta):**
4. Complete C API coverage for all message types
5. C bindings error handling and error codes
6. CMake support and pkg-config for C bindings
7. Performance regression detection in CI
8. "Deploy to Embedded Linux" guide (Raspberry Pi/Jetson)

**MEDIUM (Nice-to-have for Beta):**
9. ARM platform build verification in CI
10. Expand C++ examples for embedded platforms
11. Centralized error code reference page

**LOW (Can be deferred):**
- 24+ hour stress tests (can run manually)
- Complete example projects in separate repo (line-follower, quadcopter, rover)
- Full ARM hardware testing (build verification sufficient)

**Estimated Time to Beta**: 2-3 weeks of focused development

**Beta focus**: Developer experience - make HORUS easy to use from Python/C with great docs, comprehensive testing, and clear migration path from ROS2.

**Note**: PyPI packaging, pre-built wheels, and .pyi stubs are deferred to post-beta as users install HORUS via `./install.sh` which builds bindings locally.
