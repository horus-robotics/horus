# HORUS Roadmap to Beta

**Status**: Core framework is production-ready. Beta focuses on developer experience: language bindings, documentation, and testing.

## 1. Core Framework (COMPLETE ✅)

### Performance & Reliability
- ✅ **Link (SPSC)**: 312ns median latency (production-validated)
- ✅ **Hub (MPMC)**: 481ns median latency (production-validated)
- ✅ **Session isolation**: Via `HORUS_SESSION_ID` environment variable
  - Sessions use isolated directory: `/dev/shm/horus/sessions/{session_id}/`
  - Cleanup: `rm -rf /dev/shm/horus/sessions/{session_id}` (entire session at once)
  - No individual file cleanup needed (Drop intentionally disabled)
- ✅ **Crash detection**: `NodeState::Crashed` tracking
- ✅ **Graceful degradation**: Buffer overflow handling
- ✅ **Topic statistics**: Comprehensive atomic metrics (Hub & Link)
- ✅ **Node health monitoring**: Heartbeat with state tracking
- ✅ **Priority-based scheduling**: NodePriority 0-4
- ✅ **Execution time tracking**: Min/max/avg per node
- ✅ **6.2M+ messages tested**: Zero corruptions

**No remaining core tasks** - Framework is production-ready!

## 2. Language Bindings (HIGH PRIORITY)

### 2.1 Python Bindings (40% of beta effort)

**Critical for Beta**:
- [ ] **Type hints**: Full `.pyi` stub files for IDE autocomplete (VSCode, PyCharm)
- [ ] **Documentation**: Docstrings for all functions, basic API reference
- [ ] **Package distribution**: PyPI package (`pip install horus-robotics`)
- [ ] **Wheels**: Linux x86_64, ARM (Raspberry Pi, Jetson)
- [ ] **Testing**: pytest test suite with cross-language integration tests

**Validation**:
- Type hint coverage >80%
- Documentation coverage >70%
- Works on real Python projects

---

### 2.2 C Bindings (25% of beta effort)

**Critical for Beta**:
- [ ] **Complete API coverage**: Node API, Scheduler API, all message types
- [ ] **Error handling**: Proper error codes and resource cleanup
- [ ] **Build system**: CMake support, pkg-config file
- [ ] **Examples**: Embedded Linux examples (Raspberry Pi, Jetson)
- [ ] **Documentation**: Basic C API reference guide

**Validation**:
- Compiles on embedded Linux (RPi, Jetson)
- Performance parity with Rust API

---

## 3. Documentation (25% of beta effort)

**Critical for Beta**:
- [ ] **Tutorials**:
  - Beginner: First robot in 30 minutes
  - Intermediate: Multi-node system
  - Advanced: Real-time control
- [ ] **How-to guides**:
  - Migrate from ROS2
  - Deploy to embedded Linux (Raspberry Pi, Jetson)
  - Debug performance issues
- [ ] **API Reference**:
  - Complete API documentation for all public APIs
  - Message type reference
  - Error code reference
- [ ] **Example projects** (2-3 complete examples):
  - Line-following robot
  - Quadcopter flight controller
  - Autonomous rover

**Validation**:
- Documentation coverage >70%
- User testing with newcomers
- All examples run successfully

---

## 4. Testing (10% of beta effort)

**Critical for Beta**:
- [ ] **Unit tests**: 80%+ code coverage for core framework
- [ ] **Integration tests**:
  - Multi-node scenarios
  - Cross-language tests (Rust ↔ Python ↔ C)
  - Long-running stress tests (24+ hours)
- [ ] **Performance regression tests**:
  - Latency benchmarks (Link/Hub)
  - Run on every commit
  - Alert on >10% regression
- [ ] **Platform tests**:
  - x86_64 Linux (Intel, AMD)
  - ARM Linux (Raspberry Pi 4/5, Jetson)

**Validation**:
- All tests passing on all platforms
- CI/CD pipeline <5 minutes
- Zero tolerance for flaky tests

---

## 5. Post-Beta Features

**The following features are deferred to post-beta releases to keep the beta focused and shippable:**

### Advanced Core Features
- Message ACK/retry for Link
- Auto-recovery for crashed nodes
- Message history/replay capability
- Late-joiner support (get last N messages)
- Dynamic type support (runtime type registration)
- Real-time scheduling (SCHED_FIFO, CPU affinity, priority inheritance)
- Parallel node execution
- Per-node rate limiting
- Node dependency graphs
- CPU/memory usage tracking per node

### Developer Tools
- Dashboard enhancements (recording/playback, profiling, log search)
- Remote deployment daemon (versioning, rollback, multi-target, CI/CD integration)

### Simulation
- sim2d enhancements (advanced physics, sensors, visualization)
- sim3d (complete 3D simulator with RL support)

### Registry & Ecosystem
- Advanced package features (transitive dependencies, analytics, ratings)
- Documentation hosting (auto-generated docs, versioning)
- Community features (discussions, issue tracking)
- horus_library expansion (50+ production-ready nodes)

### Advanced Benchmarking
- Comprehensive latency/throughput benchmarks
- Real-world scenario benchmarks (drone, SLAM, vision pipelines)
- ARM platform validation (Raspberry Pi, Jetson)
- Automated performance regression CI
