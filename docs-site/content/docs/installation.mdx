# Installation

This guide will walk you through installing HORUS on your system and getting it ready for development.

## Prerequisites

Before installing HORUS, ensure you have the following installed:

**Required:**
- **Rust** (version 1.70 or later)
- **Cargo** (comes with Rust)
- **Git**

**Optional but Recommended:**
- **Python 3.8+** (for Python bindings)
- **C Compiler** (GCC or Clang, for C bindings)

## Quick Install

The fastest way to get started with HORUS:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/HORUS
cd HORUS

# Install the global CLI tool
cargo install --path horus_manager

# Verify installation
horus --version
```

## Detailed Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Rust

If you don't have Rust installed:

```bash
# On Linux/macOS
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Follow the prompts and restart your terminal
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Verify installation
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

### Step 2: Clone HORUS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/HORUS
cd HORUS
```

### Step 3: Build the Framework

Build all HORUS components:

```bash
# Build everything (takes a few minutes first time)
cargo build --release

# Optional: Run tests to verify build
cargo test
```

### Step 4: Install Global CLI

Install the `horus` command globally:

```bash
cargo install --path horus_manager
```

This makes `horus` available system-wide in your terminal.

### Step 5: Verify Installation

Check that everything works:

```bash
# Check version
horus --version

# List available commands
horus --help
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Linux

HORUS uses shared memory (`/dev/shm`) which is available on all modern Linux distributions. No special configuration needed.

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
# Install build essentials if needed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config
```

**Fedora/RHEL:**
```bash
# Install development tools
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

### macOS

HORUS works on macOS with some limitations:

- Shared memory is available but may have size limitations
- Performance may vary compared to Linux

```bash
# Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install
```

### Windows (WSL Recommended)

For Windows, we recommend using **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**:

```bash
# Install WSL2 (PowerShell as Administrator)
wsl --install

# Then follow Linux installation instructions inside WSL
```

## Python Bindings (Optional)

To use HORUS with Python:

```bash
# Navigate to Python bindings
cd horus_py

# Build and install
maturin develop --release

# Verify Python bindings
python -c "import horus; print(horus.__version__)"
```

## C Bindings (Optional)

To use HORUS with C:

```bash
# Build C bindings
cd horus_c
cargo build --release

# The shared library will be in target/release/
# libhorus_c.so (Linux) or libhorus_c.dylib (macOS)
```

## Environment Setup

### Shell Configuration

Add HORUS binaries to your PATH (if not already added by cargo install):

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

### Shared Memory Configuration

HORUS uses `/dev/shm` for shared memory IPC. Check available space:

```bash
df -h /dev/shm
```

If you need more space (Linux):

```bash
# Increase to 2GB (requires sudo)
sudo mount -o remount,size=2G /dev/shm
```

## Updating HORUS

To update to the latest version:

```bash
# Pull latest changes
cd HORUS
git pull

# Rebuild and reinstall
cargo build --release
cargo install --path horus_manager --force
```

## Uninstalling

To remove HORUS:

```bash
# Remove global CLI
cargo uninstall horus_manager

# Remove source directory
rm -rf HORUS

# Clean shared memory (optional)
rm -f /dev/shm/horus_*
```

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: horus"

Solution: Make sure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### Build fails with "linker not found"

Solution: Install a C compiler:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# macOS
xcode-select --install
```

### Shared memory errors

Solution: Check `/dev/shm` permissions and space:

```bash
ls -la /dev/shm
df -h /dev/shm
```

### Python bindings fail to build

Solution: Install maturin:

```bash
pip install maturin
```

## Next Steps

Now that HORUS is installed, you're ready to:

- Follow the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide to build your first node
- Explore [Core Concepts](/docs/core-concepts) to understand the framework
