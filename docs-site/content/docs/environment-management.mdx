# Environment Management

Environment management in HORUS allows you to capture, save, and restore the exact set of packages and versions used in your project. Perfect for reproducible builds, team collaboration, and deployment.

## Overview

Think of environments like Python's `requirements.txt` or Node's `package-lock.json`:

- **Freeze** your current environment to a file
- **Restore** environments on different machines
- **Share** setups with teammates
- **Deploy** exact versions to production robots
- **Track** environment history in version control

## Understanding HORUS's Hidden Environment

HORUS automatically manages a hidden `.horus/` environment in each project. Understanding the **global vs local** architecture helps you work efficiently across multiple projects.

### Global Cache (Shared Storage)

**Location**: `~/.horus/cache/`

All packages are downloaded once and stored here:
```
~/.horus/cache/
├── horus_py@0.1.0/          # HORUS packages
│   └── lib/horus/
├── serde@1.0.228/           # External crates (from crates.io)
│   ├── src/
│   ├── Cargo.toml           # Cargo lives here, not your project!
│   └── lib/libserde.rlib    # Pre-compiled
└── pid-controller@1.2.0/    # More HORUS packages
```

**Benefits:**
- **Download once** - Use in all projects
- **Saves disk space** - No duplication
- **Faster setup** - Cached packages install instantly
- **Works offline** - Already have what you need

### Local Workspace (Project-Specific)

**Location**: `.horus/` in your project

Each project gets its own isolated environment:
```
my_robot_project/
├── horus.yaml               # Dependencies declared here
├── main.py                  # Your code
└── .horus/                  # Hidden automatic environment
    ├── packages/            # Symlinks to global cache
    │   ├── horus_py -> ~/.horus/cache/horus_py@0.1.0/
    │   └── serde -> ~/.horus/cache/serde@1.0.228/
    ├── bin/                 # Project binaries (auto-created)
    ├── lib/                 # Project libraries (auto-created)
    └── env.toml             # Environment metadata (auto-managed)
```

**Key Points:**
- **Workspace marker** - `.horus/` identifies a HORUS project
- **Symlinks not copies** - Points to global cache (lightweight!)
- **Isolated** - Each project independent
- **Auto-managed** - Created by `horus run`, not by you

### Automatic Workflow

When you run `horus run`:

1. **Reads** `horus.yaml` dependencies
2. **Checks** global cache - already downloaded?
3. **Downloads** if missing:
   - HORUS registry first
   - crates.io fallback for external Rust crates
4. **Compiles** external crates (in global cache with cargo)
5. **Symlinks** to `.horus/packages/` in your project
6. **Runs** your code with correct environment

**You never touch `.horus/`** - It's automatic!

### Why This Matters

**Portable**: `horus.yaml` works on any machine
```bash
# Team member clones your project
git clone your-repo
cd your-repo
horus run  # Auto-installs everything, just works!
```

**Lightweight**: Projects stay small
```bash
# Without HORUS (traditional)
project1/node_modules/  # 500 MB
project2/node_modules/  # 500 MB
project3/node_modules/  # 500 MB
# Total: 1.5 GB duplicated!

# With HORUS (global cache)
~/.horus/cache/         # 500 MB (shared)
project1/.horus/packages/  # Symlinks only (a few KB)
project2/.horus/packages/  # Symlinks only (a few KB)
project3/.horus/packages/  # Symlinks only (a few KB)
# Total: 500 MB globally, ~10 KB per project!
```

**Isolated**: Projects don't interfere
```bash
# Different versions, no problem
project_a/horus.yaml:  serde@1.0.228
project_b/horus.yaml:  serde@1.0.150
# Both work perfectly - isolated environments
```

### Solving Dependency Hell

HORUS solves dependency hell with **local-first resolution** and **smart fallback**:

**Resolution Order** (how `horus run` finds packages):
1. **Check local first** - `.horus/packages/<package>` exists? Use it immediately
2. **Check global cache** - Only if not found locally
3. **Install from registry** - Only if missing from both

**Local Always Wins:**
```bash
# Scenario: Global cache has broken package
~/.horus/cache/
└── serde@1.0.228/  # Corrupted or incompatible

my_project/.horus/packages/
└── serde@1.0.150/  # Working local version

# When you run:
horus run
# ✓ Uses local serde@1.0.150 (line 1010-1012 in run.rs)
# ✓ NEVER checks global cache
# ✓ Broken global version ignored!
```

**Automatic Smart Behavior:**

When you install a package, HORUS automatically chooses the best strategy:

```bash
horus pkg install serde
```

**If package exists in global cache:**
- Install to global cache (save disk space)
- Create symlink: `.horus/packages/serde -> ~/.horus/cache/serde@1.0.228/`
- All projects share same version efficiently

**If package NOT in global cache:**
- Install directly to local: `.horus/packages/serde@1.0.228/`
- No symlink needed - real directory
- Project is isolated from global cache

**Override Broken Global Cache:**

If global cache has corrupted or incompatible package:

```bash
# Option 1: Remove symlink and reinstall locally
rm .horus/packages/serde  # Remove symlink to broken global
horus pkg install serde   # Installs locally (global check fails)

# Option 2: Install different version locally
horus pkg install serde -v 1.0.150  # Specific working version

# Option 3: Clear global and reinstall
rm -rf ~/.horus/cache/serde@1.0.228/
horus run  # Auto-reinstalls to global
```

**Benefits:**

✅ **True isolation** - Local packages override global
✅ **No conflicts** - Version-specific directories coexist
✅ **Disk efficient** - Uses global cache when possible
✅ **Escape hatch** - Can bypass broken global cache
✅ **Zero config** - Works automatically

**Comparison with other tools:**

| Feature | Python venv | Node node_modules | HORUS |
|---------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Isolated envs | ✓ Full copies | ✓ Full copies | ✓ Symlinks + local override |
| Disk efficient | ✗ Duplicates everything | ✗ Duplicates everything | ✓ Global cache shared |
| Local override | ✓ Always local | ✓ Always local | ✓ Local-first, global fallback |
| Escape broken global | ✓ Independent | ✓ Independent | ✓ Local override |
| Multiple versions | ✗ One per venv | ✗ Nested hell | ✓ Version-specific dirs |

**Best of both worlds:**
- Disk efficiency of global cache (like Cargo, pip global)
- Isolation of virtual environments (like venv, node_modules)
- Smart automatic fallback

## Quick Start

### Save Your Environment

```bash
# Freeze to default file (horus-freeze.yaml)
horus env freeze

# Freeze to custom file
horus env freeze -o production.yaml

# Freeze and publish to registry
horus env freeze --publish
```

### Restore an Environment

```bash
# Restore from local file
horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml

# Restore from registry
horus env restore env_abc123
```

## Environment Files

### Format

Environment files use YAML format with complete package information:

**horus-freeze.yaml:**
```yaml
# HORUS Environment
# Generated: 2025-10-09T14:32:15Z
# System: Linux 6.14.0-33-generic

metadata:
  name: "Mobile Robot Production Environment"
  description: "Stable release for lab robots"
  author: "robotics-team"
  created_at: "2025-10-09T14:32:15Z"
  horus_version: "0.1.0"

packages:
  # Direct dependencies
  - name: pid-controller
    version: 1.2.0
    source: registry
    checksum: sha256:a3b2c1...
    features: ["anti-windup"]

  - name: motion-planner
    version: 2.0.1
    source: registry
    checksum: sha256:d4e5f6...
    dependencies:
      - pathfinding-utils: 1.2.0

  - name: sensor-drivers
    version: 1.5.0
    source: registry
    checksum: sha256:g7h8i9...

# Total: 3 packages (+ 1 transitive dependency)
```

### File Locations

**Default locations:**
```
my_project/
├── horus-freeze.yaml       # Default freeze file
├── production.yaml         # Custom freeze file
├── environments/           # Optional: organize freeze files
│   ├── dev.yaml
│   ├── staging.yaml
│   └── production.yaml
└── .horus/                 # Auto-managed, don't store freeze files here
    ├── packages/           # Symlinks to global cache
    ├── bin/                # Compiled binaries
    ├── lib/                # Libraries
    └── include/            # Headers
```

> **Note**: Store freeze files in your project root or a custom `environments/` folder (not inside `.horus/`). The `.horus/` directory is auto-managed and should not contain user files.

## Freezing Environments

### `horus env freeze`

Captures the current state of all installed packages.

**Usage:**
```bash
horus env freeze [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `-o, --output <FILE>` - Output file (default: `horus-freeze.yaml`)
- `--publish` - Upload to registry and generate ID

### Basic Freeze

```bash
horus env freeze
```

**Output:**
```
Analyzing environment...
  ✓ Found 5 packages (3 direct, 2 transitive)
  ✓ Verified checksums
  ✓ Generated metadata

Saved to: horus-freeze.yaml

Packages frozen:
  pid-controller@1.2.0
  motion-planner@2.0.1
  sensor-drivers@1.5.0
  pathfinding-utils@1.2.0 (transitive)
  control-utils@1.0.0 (transitive)

To restore this environment:
  horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml
```

### Custom Output File

```bash
# Save to specific file
horus env freeze -o environments/production.yaml

# Timestamp-based filename
horus env freeze -o "backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).yaml"
```

### Publish to Registry

```bash
# Freeze and upload to registry
horus env freeze --publish
```

**Output:**
```
Freezing environment...
  ✓ Captured 5 packages
  ✓ Generated manifest

Uploading to registry...
  ✓ Uploaded

Environment published:
  ID: env_abc123def456
  URL: https://marketplace.horus-registry.dev/environments/env_abc123def456

Share this environment:
  horus env restore env_abc123def456

Or save locally:
  horus env freeze -o local-copy.yaml
```

**Benefits of publishing:**
- **No file transfer** - Just share the environment ID
- **Version tracking** - Registry keeps history
- **Team access** - Anyone authenticated can restore
- **Immutable** - Can't be changed after publishing

## Common Workflows

### Development Workflow

**Setup for new developer:**
```bash
# 1. Clone project
git clone https://github.com/team/robot-controller
cd robot-controller

# 2. Restore environment
horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml

# 3. Run project
horus run --release
```

**Update dependencies:**
```bash
# 1. Install new package
horus pkg install new-feature

# 2. Test
horus run --release

# 3. Freeze updated environment
horus env freeze

# 4. Commit changes
git add horus-freeze.yaml
git commit -m "Add new-feature package"
```

### Production Deployment

**Prepare for deployment:**
```bash
# 1. Test locally
horus run --release

# 2. Freeze environment
horus env freeze -o production.yaml \
  --name "Production v2.1" \
  --description "Release for warehouse robots"

# 3. Publish to registry
horus env freeze --publish
# Output: env_abc123def456

# 4. Deploy to robot
ssh robot@192.168.1.100
horus env restore env_abc123def456
horus run --release --remote
```

### Team Collaboration

**Share exact setup:**
```bash
# Team lead freezes environment
horus env freeze --publish \
  --name "Team Development Environment" \
  --description "Standard setup for all team members"

# Output: env_team_dev_001

# Team members restore
horus env restore env_team_dev_001
```

### Multiple Environments

**Maintain separate environments:**
```bash
# Development
horus env freeze -o environments/dev.yaml

# Staging
horus env freeze -o environments/staging.yaml

# Production
horus env freeze -o environments/production.yaml
```

**Switch environments:**
```bash
# Switch to staging
horus env restore environments/staging.yaml

# Switch to production
horus env restore environments/production.yaml
```

### Rollback

**If deployment fails, rollback:**
```bash
# Restore previous working environment
horus env restore backup-20251008.yaml

# Or restore from registry
horus env restore env_previous_stable
```

## Environment Comparison

> **Note**: Environment comparison commands (`env diff`, `env status`) are planned for future releases. For now, you can manually compare freeze files or use standard diff tools.

## Best Practices

### Version Control

**Always commit environment files:**
```bash
# Add to git
git add horus-freeze.yaml
git commit -m "Update environment: add sensor-fusion package"

# .gitignore (auto-generated by `horus new`)
.horus/packages/      # Don't commit symlinks/packages
.horus/bin/           # Don't commit compiled binaries
.horus/lib/           # Don't commit libraries
.horus/include/       # Don't commit headers
.horus/cache/         # Don't commit cache
.horus/build/         # Don't commit build artifacts
```

### Environment Naming

**Use descriptive names:**
```yaml
# Good
name: "Production v2.1 - Warehouse Robots"
name: "Development - Feature Branch XYZ"
name: "Staging - Pre-release Testing"

# Bad
name: "env1"
name: "test"
name: "final_final_v2"
```

### Documentation

**Document environment purpose:**
```yaml
metadata:
  name: "Production v2.1"
  description: |
    Stable production environment for warehouse robots.

    Features:
    - PID controller with anti-windup
    - Motion planner with obstacle avoidance
    - Sensor drivers for LIDAR and IMU

    Tested on:
    - Robot A (192.168.1.100)
    - Robot B (192.168.1.101)
    - Robot C (192.168.1.102)

    Last updated: 2025-10-09
    Contact: robotics-team@company.com
```

### Periodic Freezes

**Freeze regularly:**
```bash
# Before major changes
horus env freeze -o backup-before-upgrade.yaml

# After successful testing
horus env freeze -o stable-$(date +%Y%m%d).yaml

# Before deployment
horus env freeze -o production-v$(git describe --tags).yaml
```

### Environment Hygiene

**Keep environments clean:**
```bash
# Remove unused packages
horus pkg list
horus pkg remove unused-package

# Refreeze
horus env freeze
```

## Troubleshooting

### Package Not Available

**Error:**
```
Error: Package 'legacy-driver@0.5.0' not found in registry
```

**Causes:**
- Package was unpublished
- Version no longer available
- Registry connection issue

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Option 1: Update environment file
# Remove or replace unavailable package

# Option 2: Install alternative
horus pkg install modern-driver
horus env freeze  # Update freeze file

# Option 3: Use cached version
ls ~/.horus/cache/legacy-driver@0.5.0/
```

### Checksum Mismatch

**Error:**
```
Error: Checksum mismatch for 'pid-controller@1.2.0'
  Expected: sha256:a3b2c1...
  Got:      sha256:x9y8z7...
```

**Causes:**
- Package was modified on registry
- Corrupted download
- Network issue

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Reinstall the package
horus pkg remove pid-controller
horus pkg install pid-controller -v 1.2.0
```

### Version Conflicts

**Error:**
```
Error: Cannot satisfy version constraints
  motion-planner requires pathfinding-utils ^1.2
  sensor-fusion requires pathfinding-utils ^1.0
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Option 1: Install compatible version
horus pkg install sensor-fusion -v 2.0.0

# Option 2: Edit environment file manually
# Change pathfinding-utils version to compatible one

# Option 3: Remove conflicting package
horus pkg remove sensor-fusion
horus env freeze  # Update freeze file
```

### Registry Unavailable

**Error:**
```
Error: Failed to fetch environment from registry
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Use local file instead
horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml
```

> **Note**: Environment registry management commands (`env list`, `env info`, `env delete`, `env export`) are planned for future releases. For now, manage published environments through the registry web interface at https://marketplace.horus-registry.dev
