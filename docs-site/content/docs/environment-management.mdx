# Environment Management

Environment management in HORUS allows you to capture, save, and restore the exact set of packages and versions used in your project. Perfect for reproducible builds, team collaboration, and deployment.

## Overview

Think of environments like Python's `requirements.txt` or Node's `package-lock.json`:

- **Freeze** your current environment to a file
- **Restore** environments on different machines
- **Share** setups with teammates
- **Deploy** exact versions to production robots
- **Track** environment history in version control

## Quick Start

### Save Your Environment

```bash
# Freeze to default file (horus-freeze.yaml)
horus env freeze

# Freeze to custom file
horus env freeze -o production.yaml

# Freeze and publish to registry
horus env freeze --publish
```

### Restore an Environment

```bash
# Restore from local file
horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml

# Restore from registry
horus env restore env_abc123
```

## Environment Files

### Format

Environment files use YAML format with complete package information:

**horus-freeze.yaml:**
```yaml
# HORUS Environment
# Generated: 2025-10-09T14:32:15Z
# System: Linux 6.14.0-33-generic

metadata:
  name: "Mobile Robot Production Environment"
  description: "Stable release for lab robots"
  author: "robotics-team"
  created_at: "2025-10-09T14:32:15Z"
  horus_version: "0.1.0"

packages:
  # Direct dependencies
  - name: pid-controller
    version: 1.2.0
    source: registry
    checksum: sha256:a3b2c1...
    features: ["anti-windup"]

  - name: motion-planner
    version: 2.0.1
    source: registry
    checksum: sha256:d4e5f6...
    dependencies:
      - pathfinding-utils: 1.2.0

  - name: sensor-drivers
    version: 1.5.0
    source: registry
    checksum: sha256:g7h8i9...

# Total: 3 packages (+ 1 transitive dependency)
```

### File Locations

**Default locations:**
```
my_project/
├── horus-freeze.yaml       # Default freeze file
├── production.yaml         # Custom freeze file
└── .horus/
    └── environments/
        ├── dev.yaml
        ├── staging.yaml
        └── production.yaml
```

## Freezing Environments

### `horus env freeze`

Captures the current state of all installed packages.

**Usage:**
```bash
horus env freeze [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `-o, --output <FILE>` - Output file (default: `horus-freeze.yaml`)
- `--publish` - Upload to registry and generate ID
- `--name <NAME>` - Environment name
- `--description <DESC>` - Environment description

### Basic Freeze

```bash
horus env freeze
```

**Output:**
```
Analyzing environment...
  ✓ Found 5 packages (3 direct, 2 transitive)
  ✓ Verified checksums
  ✓ Generated metadata

Saved to: horus-freeze.yaml

Packages frozen:
  pid-controller@1.2.0
  motion-planner@2.0.1
  sensor-drivers@1.5.0
  pathfinding-utils@1.2.0 (transitive)
  control-utils@1.0.0 (transitive)

To restore this environment:
  horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml
```

### Custom Output File

```bash
# Save to specific file
horus env freeze -o environments/production.yaml

# Timestamp-based filename
horus env freeze -o "backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).yaml"
```

### Named Environments

```bash
horus env freeze \
  --name "Production v2.1" \
  --description "Stable release for warehouse robots" \
  -o production-v2.1.yaml
```

**Generated file includes metadata:**
```yaml
metadata:
  name: "Production v2.1"
  description: "Stable release for warehouse robots"
  author: "robotics-team"
  created_at: "2025-10-09T14:45:00Z"
  # ...
```

### Publish to Registry

```bash
# Freeze and upload to registry
horus env freeze --publish
```

**Output:**
```
Freezing environment...
  ✓ Captured 5 packages
  ✓ Generated manifest

Uploading to registry...
  ✓ Uploaded

Environment published:
  ID: env_abc123def456
  URL: https://registry.horus.dev/environments/env_abc123def456

Share this environment:
  horus env restore env_abc123def456

Or save locally:
  horus env freeze -o local-copy.yaml
```

**Benefits of publishing:**
- **No file transfer** - Just share the environment ID
- **Version tracking** - Registry keeps history
- **Team access** - Anyone authenticated can restore
- **Immutable** - Can't be changed after publishing

## Restoring Environments

### `horus env restore`

Installs the exact packages from a frozen environment.

**Usage:**
```bash
horus env restore <FILE_OR_ID>
```

**Options:**
- `-g, --global` - Install packages globally
- `--force` - Reinstall even if already present
- `--verify` - Verify checksums after installation

### Restore from File

```bash
# Restore from local file
horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml

## Common Workflows

### Development Workflow

**Setup for new developer:**
```bash
# 1. Clone project
git clone https://github.com/team/robot-controller
cd robot-controller

# 2. Restore environment
horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml

# 3. Run project
horus run --release
```

**Update dependencies:**
```bash
# 1. Install new package
horus pkg install new-feature

# 2. Test
horus run --release

# 3. Freeze updated environment
horus env freeze

# 4. Commit changes
git add horus-freeze.yaml
git commit -m "Add new-feature package"
```

### Production Deployment

**Prepare for deployment:**
```bash
# 1. Test locally
horus run --release

# 2. Freeze environment
horus env freeze -o production.yaml \
  --name "Production v2.1" \
  --description "Release for warehouse robots"

# 3. Publish to registry
horus env freeze --publish
# Output: env_abc123def456

# 4. Deploy to robot
ssh robot@192.168.1.100
horus env restore env_abc123def456
horus run --release --remote
```

### Team Collaboration

**Share exact setup:**
```bash
# Team lead freezes environment
horus env freeze --publish \
  --name "Team Development Environment" \
  --description "Standard setup for all team members"

# Output: env_team_dev_001

# Team members restore
horus env restore env_team_dev_001
```

### Multiple Environments

**Maintain separate environments:**
```bash
# Development
horus env freeze -o .horus/environments/dev.yaml

# Staging
horus env freeze -o .horus/environments/staging.yaml

# Production
horus env freeze -o .horus/environments/production.yaml
```

**Switch environments:**
```bash
# Switch to staging
horus env restore .horus/environments/staging.yaml

# Switch to production
horus env restore .horus/environments/production.yaml
```

### Rollback

**If deployment fails, rollback:**
```bash
# Restore previous working environment
horus env restore backup-20251008.yaml

# Or restore from registry
horus env restore env_previous_stable
```

## Environment Comparison

### Compare Two Environments

```bash
# Show differences between environments
horus env diff horus-freeze.yaml production.yaml
```

**Output:**
```
Comparing environments:
  Local: horus-freeze.yaml (5 packages)
  Remote: production.yaml (4 packages)

Differences:
  + sensor-fusion@1.0.0 (only in horus-freeze.yaml)
  ! pid-controller: 1.2.0 → 1.3.0 (version changed)
  - legacy-driver@0.5.0 (removed in horus-freeze.yaml)

Summary:
  1 added
  1 version changed
  1 removed
```

### Check Environment Status

```bash
# Show current vs frozen state
horus env status
```

**Output:**
```
Current environment vs horus-freeze.yaml:

Matching:
  ✓ motion-planner@2.0.1
  ✓ sensor-drivers@1.5.0

Outdated:
  WARNING: pid-controller: 1.2.0 (frozen) → 1.3.0 (installed)

Missing:
  ✗ control-utils@1.0.0 (in freeze file, not installed)

Status: Out of sync
Run 'horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml' to synchronize
```

## Best Practices

### Version Control

**Always commit environment files:**
```bash
# Add to git
git add horus-freeze.yaml
git commit -m "Update environment: add sensor-fusion package"

# .gitignore
.horus/packages/      # Don't commit downloaded packages
.horus/cache/         # Don't commit cache
```

### Environment Naming

**Use descriptive names:**
```yaml
# Good
name: "Production v2.1 - Warehouse Robots"
name: "Development - Feature Branch XYZ"
name: "Staging - Pre-release Testing"

# Bad
name: "env1"
name: "test"
name: "final_final_v2"
```

### Documentation

**Document environment purpose:**
```yaml
metadata:
  name: "Production v2.1"
  description: |
    Stable production environment for warehouse robots.

    Features:
    - PID controller with anti-windup
    - Motion planner with obstacle avoidance
    - Sensor drivers for LIDAR and IMU

    Tested on:
    - Robot A (192.168.1.100)
    - Robot B (192.168.1.101)
    - Robot C (192.168.1.102)

    Contact: robotics-team@company.com
```

### Periodic Freezes

**Freeze regularly:**
```bash
# Before major changes
horus env freeze -o backup-before-upgrade.yaml

# After successful testing
horus env freeze -o stable-$(date +%Y%m%d).yaml

# Before deployment
horus env freeze -o production-v$(git describe --tags).yaml
```

### Environment Hygiene

**Keep environments clean:**
```bash
# Remove unused packages
horus pkg list
horus pkg remove unused-package

# Refreeze
horus env freeze

# Verify
horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml --verify
```

## Troubleshooting

### Package Not Available

**Error:**
```
Error: Package 'legacy-driver@0.5.0' not found in registry
```

**Causes:**
- Package was unpublished
- Version no longer available
- Registry connection issue

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Option 1: Update environment file
# Remove or replace unavailable package

# Option 2: Install alternative
horus pkg install modern-driver
horus env freeze  # Update freeze file

# Option 3: Use cached version
ls ~/.horus/cache/legacy-driver@0.5.0/
```

### Checksum Mismatch

**Error:**
```
Error: Checksum mismatch for 'pid-controller@1.2.0'
  Expected: sha256:a3b2c1...
  Got:      sha256:x9y8z7...
```

**Causes:**
- Package was modified on registry
- Corrupted download
- Network issue

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Force reinstall
horus pkg remove pid-controller
horus pkg install pid-controller -v 1.2.0 --force

# Skip verification (not recommended)
horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml --no-verify
```

### Version Conflicts

**Error:**
```
Error: Cannot satisfy version constraints
  motion-planner requires pathfinding-utils ^1.2
  sensor-fusion requires pathfinding-utils ^1.0
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Option 1: Update conflicting package
horus pkg install sensor-fusion --force  # Gets compatible version

# Option 2: Edit environment file manually
# Change pathfinding-utils version to compatible one

# Option 3: Remove conflicting package
horus pkg remove sensor-fusion
horus env freeze  # Update freeze file
```

### Registry Unavailable

**Error:**
```
Error: Failed to fetch environment from registry
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Use local file instead
horus env restore horus-freeze.yaml

# Export from registry when available
horus env export env_abc123def456 -o local-copy.yaml
horus env restore local-copy.yaml
```

## Environment Registry
