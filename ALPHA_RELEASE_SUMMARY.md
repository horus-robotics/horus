# HORUS Alpha Release - Quick Summary

## Status at a Glance

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Core Framework** | 95% | Production-ready, proven latency |
| **CLI Tools** | 80% | Most features work, some incomplete |
| **Documentation** | 85% | Excellent README, missing roadmap/changelog |
| **Testing** | 85% | Good CI/CD, missing coverage tracking |
| **Community Readiness** | 60% | No CoC, templates, security policy |
| **Overall** | 80% | Ready for alpha, needs polish |

## What Works Well

### Core Framework (Excellent)
- Hub: Lock-free, zero-copy IPC
- Scheduler: Priority-based execution
- Node trait: Clean, simple API
- Performance: 366ns-2.8μs verified

### Developer Experience
- `horus new/run/dashboard` commands
- Python/C bindings exist
- Good error messages
- Professional install script

### Quality Infrastructure
- 3x CI/CD workflows (test, benchmark, release)
- rustfmt + clippy enforcement
- Multi-OS testing (Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04)
- Benchmarking automation

## What Needs Work (Before Public Alpha)

### Critical Issues
1. ❌ **No CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Community standards missing
2. ❌ **No SECURITY.md** - Vulnerability policy undefined
3. ❌ **No GitHub issue templates** - Bug reports inconsistent
4. ❌ **No CHANGELOG.md** - Release history missing
5. ❌ **Package manager incomplete** - Registry backend missing

### Important Gaps
1. ⚠️ **No ROADMAP** - Unclear where project is heading
2. ⚠️ **No governance** - Decision-making process unclear
3. ⚠️ **Tool limitations undocumented** - Dashboard, publish, deploy incomplete
4. ⚠️ **No pre-commit hooks** - Local testing not automated
5. ⚠️ **Limited examples** - Only SnakeSim and Sim2D shown

### Nice-to-Have
- Docker dev environment
- Video tutorials
- Performance tuning guide
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Full multiplatform testing

## Incomplete Features ("not fully with tools")

| Tool | Status | Problem |
|------|--------|---------|
| Dashboard | 70% | TUI mode incomplete, real-time updates unstable |
| Package Manager | 50% | No registry backend, search incomplete |
| Environment Mgmt | 70% | Freeze/restore works, edge cases unclear |
| Remote Deploy | 60% | Basic HTTP works, no auth/versioning/rollback |
| Publish | 40% | Command exists, no actual registry backend |
| Python Bindings | 80% | Works, no type hints, limited docs |
| C Bindings | 75% | Works for hardware, minimal API |

## Action Items for Alpha Release

### Must Do (Week 1)
- [ ] Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (50 min)
- [ ] Create SECURITY.md (30 min)
- [ ] Add GitHub issue templates (1 hour)
- [ ] Update README with tool limitations (30 min)
- [ ] Document incomplete features (1 hour)

### Should Do (Week 2)
- [ ] Add CHANGELOG.md for v0.1.0 (1 hour)
- [ ] Create ROADMAP.md (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Add .pre-commit-config.yaml (30 min)
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for dev (1 hour)
- [ ] Add GitHub PR template (30 min)

### Nice to Have (After Alpha)
- [ ] Implement actual package registry
- [ ] Complete dashboard features
- [ ] Add video tutorials
- [ ] Create ADRs for architecture
- [ ] Type hints for Python bindings

## For Contributors

### Current State
- Fork/branch workflow ready ✓
- Testing documented ✓
- Code style enforced ✓
- CLA in place ✓

### What's Missing
- Code of Conduct (unclear expectations)
- Issue templates (inconsistent reports)
- Governance (unclear approval process)
- Roadmap (don't know what to work on)

## Recommended Messaging

**For Alpha Release:**
> "HORUS 0.1.0 Alpha: Production-grade core framework with tools in active development. Core IPC proven at 366ns-2.8μs latency. Tooling (dashboard, package manager, deployment) completing through beta."

## Time Estimates to Production Ready

- **Make production-ready**: 40 hours (docs, templates, governance)
- **Make fully production-ready**: 80 hours (+ registry backend, full tooling)

## Most Important Fix

Add this one file: **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**

It signals:
1. This is a serious, professional project
2. Community is welcome
3. We have standards and will enforce them
4. Safe space for contributors

Most impactful, lowest effort action item.
