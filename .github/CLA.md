# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the HORUS project. In order to clarify the intellectual property rights in the project, and to grant licenses to the project and users of the software, we require contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement.

## Why a CLA?

The CLA:
- **Protects you** - Ensures you have the rights to contribute what you submit
- **Protects the project** - Ensures the project can safely distribute your contributions
- **Protects users** - Ensures users can rely on the project's licensing
- **Enables future licensing** - Allows the project to update licenses if needed

## Agreement

By submitting a contribution (via pull request, patch, or other means) to the HORUS project, you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Definitions

**"You"** means the individual or Legal Entity submitting a Contribution to the project.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to existing work, that you submit to the HORUS project for inclusion in any product owned or managed by the project.

**"Submit"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the HORUS project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to the HORUS project and to recipients of software distributed by the project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce your Contributions
- Prepare derivative works of your Contributions
- Publicly display your Contributions
- Publicly perform your Contributions
- Sublicense your Contributions
- Distribute your Contributions and derivative works thereof

This license applies to all forms of the work, including Source and Object forms.

### 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to the HORUS project and to recipients of software distributed by the project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated below) patent license to:

- Make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your Contributions

This license applies only to patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of your Contribution(s) with the project to which you submitted the Contribution.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against you or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the project to which you contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 4. Your Representations

You represent that:

1. **You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses.** If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the project.

2. **Each of your Contributions is your original creation.** You represent that your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of your Contributions.

3. **You provide your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND**, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### 5. Notification of Changes

You agree to notify the HORUS project of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.

### 6. Additional Terms

- This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements or understandings with respect to your Contributions to the project.
- This Agreement is governed by the laws of the United States.
- You acknowledge that the HORUS project is under no obligation to use or incorporate your Contributions into the project.
- The HORUS project reserves the right to reject any Contribution that does not comply with this Agreement.
