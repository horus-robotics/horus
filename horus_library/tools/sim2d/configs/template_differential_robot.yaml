# Camera sensor configuration
camera:
  enabled: false  # Set to true to enable camera
  # Note: Camera feature requires additional configuration
  # Published to: <topic_prefix>/camera

# Additional sensors (automatically enabled):
# - Odometry: <topic_prefix>/odom
# - IMU: <topic_prefix>/imu
# - Ground truth pose: <topic_prefix>/pose

# Control interface:
# - Subscribe to: <topic_prefix>/cmd_vel (CmdVel messages)
#   - linear: forward/backward velocity (m/s)
#   - angular: rotational velocity (rad/s)

# Example usage:
#   sim2d --robot configs/template_differential_robot.yaml
#   horus run "echo 'CmdVel(1.0, 0.0)' > robot.cmd_vel"
