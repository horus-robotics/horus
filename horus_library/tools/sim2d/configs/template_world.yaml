# World Configuration Template
# This template defines the simulation environment
# Copy and modify for custom worlds

# World dimensions (meters)
width: 20.0
height: 15.0

# Obstacles in the world
obstacles:
  # Rectangle obstacle example
  - pos: [10.0, 7.5]        # [x, y] center position in meters
    size: [2.0, 1.5]        # [width, height] in meters
    shape: rectangle
    color: [0.6, 0.4, 0.2]  # Optional RGB color (0.0-1.0), brown

  # Circle obstacle example
  - pos: [5.0, 5.0]         # [x, y] center position
    size: [1.5, 1.5]        # [diameter, diameter] for circles
    shape: circle
    color: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]  # Optional RGB color, gray

  # Wall example (long thin rectangle)
  - pos: [15.0, 10.0]
    size: [0.2, 10.0]       # Thin width, tall height
    shape: rectangle
    color: [0.3, 0.3, 0.3]  # Dark gray wall

  # Goal marker example (small bright obstacle)
  - pos: [18.0, 13.0]
    size: [0.5, 0.5]
    shape: circle
    color: [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]  # Bright green for goal

# Notes:
# - Coordinates are in meters
# - Origin (0, 0) is bottom-left corner
# - Maximum coordinates are (width, height)
# - Obstacles are static (immovable)
# - For dynamic obstacles, see examples/dynamic_obstacles.py

# Common world patterns:

# Empty world (no obstacles):
#   obstacles: []

# Maze-like environment:
#   - Use multiple thin rectangles as walls
#   - Leave corridors for navigation
#   - Example size for walls: [0.5, length]

# Warehouse layout:
#   - Large rectangles for shelving units
#   - Narrow passages between shelves
#   - Open areas for loading/unloading

# Outdoor environment:
#   - Scattered circular obstacles (trees, poles)
#   - Larger world size (e.g., 50x50m)
#   - Fewer but larger obstacles

# Parking lot:
#   - Rectangular parking spaces
#   - Lane markings (thin rectangles)
#   - Boundary walls

# Tips:
# 1. Start with a few large obstacles, then add detail
# 2. Use contrasting colors for different obstacle types
# 3. Leave enough space for robot to navigate
# 4. Typical robot size: 0.5-1.0m, plan accordingly
# 5. Use bright colors (green, yellow) for goals/waypoints
# 6. Keep world size reasonable (15-30m) for visualization

# Example usage:
#   sim2d --world configs/template_world.yaml --robot configs/template_differential_robot.yaml
