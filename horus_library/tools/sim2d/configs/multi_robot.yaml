# Multi-robot configuration for sim2d
# This demonstrates how to spawn multiple robots with independent control topics

robots:
  # First robot - Green
  - name: robot0
    topic_prefix: /robot0
    position: [-3.0, 0.0]  # Start position [x, y] in meters
    width: 0.5
    length: 0.8
    max_speed: 2.0
    color: [0.2, 0.8, 0.2]  # RGB [0.0-1.0] - Green

  # Second robot - Red
  - name: robot1
    topic_prefix: /robot1
    position: [0.0, 0.0]
    width: 0.5
    length: 0.8
    max_speed: 2.0
    color: [0.8, 0.2, 0.2]  # RGB [0.0-1.0] - Red

  # Third robot - Blue
  - name: robot2
    topic_prefix: /robot2
    position: [3.0, 0.0]
    width: 0.5
    length: 0.8
    max_speed: 2.0
    color: [0.2, 0.2, 0.8]  # RGB [0.0-1.0] - Blue

# Each robot will have independent topics:
# - Command input: {topic_prefix}/cmd_vel
# - Odometry output: {topic_prefix}/odom
# - LiDAR output: {topic_prefix}/scan
# - IMU output: {topic_prefix}/imu
#
# Shared topic:
# - Obstacle commands: /sim2d/obstacle_cmd (shared by all robots)
#
# Example usage:
#   horus sim2d --robot configs/multi_robot.yaml
