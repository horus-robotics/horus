# Omnidirectional Robot Template (Holonomic Drive)
# This is a template for an omnidirectional holonomic robot
# Can move in any direction without changing orientation
# Copy and modify this file for your custom holonomic robot

name: "omnidirectional_robot"
topic_prefix: "holonomic"  # HORUS topic prefix for all robot messages

# Initial position and orientation
position: [0.0, 0.0]  # [x, y] in meters

# Physical dimensions (typically square/circular for omni robots)
width: 0.6    # meters (side-to-side)
length: 0.6   # meters (front-to-back, often equal to width)

# Performance
max_speed: 2.5  # meters per second (can be faster due to efficient movement)

# Visual appearance
color: [0.3, 0.7, 0.9]  # RGB color (0.0-1.0 range) - cyan for omni

# Robot kinematics
kinematics:
  kinematic_type: omnidirectional  # Holonomic drive
  # No additional parameters needed for omnidirectional drive

# LIDAR sensor configuration
lidar:
  enabled: true
  range_max: 10.0      # Maximum detection range (meters)
  range_min: 0.1       # Minimum detection range (meters)
  num_rays: 360        # Number of laser rays

# Camera sensor configuration
camera:
  enabled: false  # Set to true to enable camera
  # Published to: <topic_prefix>/camera

# Additional sensors (automatically enabled):
# - Odometry: <topic_prefix>/odom
# - IMU: <topic_prefix>/imu
# - Ground truth pose: <topic_prefix>/pose

# Control interface:
# - Subscribe to: <topic_prefix>/cmd_vel (CmdVel messages)
#   - linear: X velocity in robot frame (m/s) - forward/backward
#   - angular: Y velocity in robot frame (m/s) - left/right strafe
#
# IMPORTANT: For omnidirectional robots:
#   - 'linear' controls forward/backward motion
#   - 'angular' controls left/right strafing (NOT rotation!)
#   - Robot does NOT rotate from velocity commands
#   - Can combine both for diagonal movement

# Movement examples:
#   Forward:           CmdVel(1.0, 0.0)
#   Backward:          CmdVel(-1.0, 0.0)
#   Strafe right:      CmdVel(0.0, 1.0)
#   Strafe left:       CmdVel(0.0, -1.0)
#   Diagonal (NE):     CmdVel(0.7, 0.7)   # 45-degree angle
#   Diagonal (SW):     CmdVel(-0.7, -0.7)
#   Diagonal (NW):     CmdVel(0.7, -0.7)
#   Diagonal (SE):     CmdVel(-0.7, 0.7)

# Example usage:
#   sim2d --robot configs/template_omnidirectional_robot.yaml
#   horus run "echo 'CmdVel(0.7, 0.7)' > holonomic.cmd_vel"   # Move diagonally NE
#   horus run "echo 'CmdVel(0.0, 1.0)' > holonomic.cmd_vel"   # Strafe right
#   horus run "echo 'CmdVel(-1.0, 0.5)' > holonomic.cmd_vel"  # Move back-right

# Advantages of omnidirectional robots:
# 1. Can move in any direction instantly
# 2. No need to rotate before moving
# 3. Can navigate tight spaces more efficiently
# 4. Better for warehouse/indoor environments
# 5. Can maintain orientation while moving

# Use cases:
# - Warehouse automation
# - Indoor delivery robots
# - Research platforms
# - AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles)
# - Scenarios requiring precise positioning

# Note: Real omnidirectional robots typically use:
# - Mecanum wheels (4 wheels with rollers at 45 degrees)
# - Omni wheels (wheels with perpendicular rollers)
# - Kiwi drive (3 wheels at 120 degrees)
