"""
HORUS Library Nodes - Reusable robotics nodes

Python implementations of standard robotics nodes.
Currently, most nodes are implemented in Rust and exposed via horus_py.

Future: Python-native node implementations will be added here.

# Placeholder for future Python node implementations
# For now, users should use Rust nodes via horus_py or implement custom nodes
