---

## Breaking Changes Policy

**Until v1.0.0:**
- Minor versions (0.x.0) may include breaking changes
- Patch versions (0.0.x) are backward compatible
- Breaking changes will be clearly documented
- Migration guides provided for all breaking changes

**After v1.0.0:**
- Semantic versioning strictly followed
- Major versions only for breaking changes
- Deprecation warnings for at least one minor version
- Long-term support for major versions

---

## Success Metrics

We track the following metrics to measure progress:

**Performance**
- Message latency (target: <100ns for 16B)
- Throughput (target: >10M msg/sec)
- Memory overhead (target: <10MB baseline)

**Adoption**
- GitHub stars
- Package downloads
- Active contributors
- Production deployments

**Quality**
- Test coverage (target: >90%)
- Bug report resolution time (target: <7 days)
- Documentation completeness
- API stability
