# HORUS Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for HORUS. Priorities and timelines may change based on community feedback and contributions.

## Current Version: v0.1.0-alpha

The core framework is production-ready with proven sub-microsecond latency. Ecosystem tools are functional but incomplete.

**Dashboard Improvements**
- Status: 70% complete (web works, TUI incomplete)
- Goal: Production-ready monitoring solution
- Tasks:
  - Complete TUI mode implementation
  - Stabilize real-time updates
  - Add historical metrics visualization
  - Implement node pause/resume controls
  - Add export functionality for metrics

**Remote Deployment**
- Status: 70% complete (HTTP + authentication works)
- Goal: Production-ready remote deployment with versioning
- Tasks:
  - Implement versioning and rollback
  - Add deployment status tracking
  - Support multi-robot deployments
  - Add health checks and monitoring

### Priority 2: Developer Experience

**Python Bindings Enhancement**
- Add type hints for all APIs
- Improve error messages

## Breaking Changes Policy

**Until v1.0.0:**
- Minor versions (0.x.0) may include breaking changes
- Patch versions (0.0.x) are backward compatible
- Breaking changes will be clearly documented
- Migration guides provided for all breaking changes

**After v1.0.0:**
- Semantic versioning strictly followed
- Major versions only for breaking changes
- Deprecation warnings for at least one minor version
- Long-term support for major versions

---

## Success Metrics

We track the following metrics to measure progress:

**Performance**
- Message latency (target: <100ns for 16B)
- Throughput (target: >10M msg/sec)
- Memory overhead (target: <10MB baseline)

**Adoption**
- GitHub stars
- Package downloads
- Active contributors
- Production deployments

**Quality**
- Test coverage (target: >90%)
- Bug report resolution time (target: <7 days)
